# Project Swing

Project Swing (working title) is a 3d platformer game developed in with the Unity Engine.

The game is inspired by classic 3d platformer games, especially Sonic Adventure. This is my passion project, and a great deal of time has been put into this. The game is still in very early stages, as most of the work has gone into creating a custom collision and physics engine from the ground up.

To play the development build, download the "Builds" folder, and run the .exe file.
